#  AI Wellness Buddy

**AI Wellness Buddy** is an intelligent wellness companion that helps you track your **daily habits, mood, and health** while offering personalized AI-powered recommendations for a balanced lifestyle.

##  Inspiration

The idea came from realizing how many people struggle to balance their **mental and physical health** in their busy routines.  
I wanted to build an **AI-powered friend** that listens, analyzes habits (sleep, food, mood), and suggests small actions to improve overall well-being.
